While at Mailman School of Public Health I have focusesd on infectious disease epidemiology and statistics. My purpose for returning to graduate school has been to acquire as many hard skills in epidemiology and outbreak investigation that is necessary for supproting the Bureau of Communicable Diseases at NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time while at Mailman and have felt continuously impressed by the applicability of courses taken thus far.

The four years I spent at Notre Dame were unfortuantely four of the longest years of my life that I did not quite enjoy. As a Georgia kid who was used to mild winters and no snow, four years of perpetual Midwest winters that lasted until May was very difficult for me. While some fond memories remain, such as football games and some social events. My undergraduate years were powerful in teaching what I do not enjoy.
