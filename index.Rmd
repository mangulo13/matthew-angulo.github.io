# My name is Matthew Angulo

I am an Infectious Disease graduate student at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. This website serves as a summary of my personal and professional interests, accomplishments, and aspirations. 

As I continue in my career, I will update this site with recent projects and data analysis. <br><br>

This website consists of several sections including:

* [An introduction to my personal goals and interests](personal.html) 
* [An overview of my work experience ](professional_work.html)
* [A summary of my academic background](professional_education.html)
* [My resume](professional_resume.html)
* [An example of my work in data analysis](dashboard.html)
 
<br>

I am eager to continue studies and work in infectious epidemiology. For any inquiries, please feel free to connect with me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-s-angulo/) or by [email.](mailto:<ma3997@columbia.edu>) Thank you and enjoy this site.
