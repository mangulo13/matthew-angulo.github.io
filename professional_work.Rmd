### COVID-19 Case Investigator

As a contact tracer for NYCHHC I have conducted over 500 interviews with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases, presumed cases, and close contacts. This has been an incredible experience in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic in NYC. I have paired skills in communication with knowledge of COVID-19 epidemiology to connect with cases and contacts and provide them guidance on how to isolate, quarantine, and take care.

### Impact Manager 

As an impact manager with City Year NYC, I was responsible for 7 AmeriCorp Members as they served in 3-5th grade classrooms in Public School 108K in East New York, Brooklyn. The three buckets of my responsibilites for this role were: student data, liasing with school administration, and directly managing AmeriCorp Members' daily activities. My year as an Impact Manager was my second year at PS 108K and I continue to have the highest respect and admiration for educators - particularlly those that so graciously partnered with City Year New York. 

### AmeriCorps Member

As an AmeriCorps Member with City Year New York, I spent 1700 hours working in a 3rd grade dual language, Spanish-English, classroom at PS 108K. Consistently working 50 hours a week taught me routine and the beauty of a strong work schedule. While serving on a diverse team of 10 AmeriCorps Members I learned that collaboration and support are crucial to success.
